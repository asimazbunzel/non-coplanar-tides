# TIDES

Implementation of the contribution of non-coplanarity into the tidal evolution of [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/r15140/)

This code contains the tidal evolution as described in [Repetto & Nelemans, 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.444..542R/abstract)
by using the `use_other_sync_spin_to_orbit` and `use_other_edot_tidal` flags of the MESAbinary module

This project is currently under development, it's not safe to use
